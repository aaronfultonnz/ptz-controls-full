# PTZ Controls
Basic movment controls for PTZ cameras using the ONVIF protocol.

Most PTZ camera (such as security cameras) use the ONVIF protocol for control and this software should be compatiable with any camera that supports ONVIF.

This software provides basic controls to move a PTZ (Pan-tilt-zoom) camera left, right, up, and down, as well as zooming in and out.

This is useful to control a remote camera that might be streaming into software such as OBS
